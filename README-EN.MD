## Update Log

### 0518 - 1.0.3 Further Optimization

Continued to fix some issues for 1.0.3, no new features added.

**Memory System**

*   Resolved potential application crashes caused by the memory system.
*   Removed redundant settings button.
*   Added more processing methods for table memory, now including: Rebuild, Repair, Summary, Simplify, Refresh, etc.

**Global Regex**

*   If the regex to clear user input causes a message sending error (under construction).
*   When importing a character card, if the card has a regex script, it will be automatically bound to the character.

**Bug Fixes**

### 0514 - 1.0.3

**1. Regex Enhancement**

*   Updated global and local regular expressions for character binding.
*   When importing a character card, character-bound regex will be automatically imported, but you need to bind and save it on the Regex page.

**2. Frontend Card Adaption**

*   Supports using regular expressions with frontend cards for gameplay.
*   **Note:**
    *   If the frontend card is not fully adapted for mobile, there may be some loss of functionality.
    *   If the opening message is not a standard HTML page, the application will attempt to auto-complete it, but it's not guaranteed to cover all cases. It is recommended to complete it to a standard HTML page format before importing. For example:

**3. Page Log**

*   Added a page log to view request messages and results.

**4. Bug Fixes**

*   Fixed issues with importing some large character cards.
*   Fixed some prompt issues in the Circle feature.
*   Fixed the issue where Global World Info could not be saved.
*   Fixed the issue where Global Presets could not be modified.

**5. UI Optimization**

*   Supports hiding the top bar.
*   Optimized the responsive layout of the Global Settings page.

**6. New Text Macros**

*   `{{lastusermessage}}`: The latest user message, equivalent to the existing `{{lastmessage}}`.
*   `{{lastcharmessage}}`: The latest character message.
*   `{{random::A::B...}}`: Will be replaced by a random value from the provided parameters. For example, `{{random::A::B::C}}` will be replaced by one of A, B, or C. If no parameters are provided, it will be replaced by a random number between 0 and 1.
*   `{{roll::A}}`: Will be replaced by a random number between 1 and A. If A starts with `d`, it will be replaced by a random number between 1 and A, excluding `d`.

**7. Opening Message Enhancement**

*   Supports importing multiple opening messages when importing a character card, which can be switched on the details page.

**8. Error Handling**

*   User and AI message entries corresponding to erroneous requests will be automatically cleared.

**9. Performance Optimization**

*   Optimized page performance and layout, reducing lag and heating issues.
*   Resolved crashing issues when sending messages on some devices.

## Deployment Method

This application is developed based on the [Expo](https://expo.dev/) framework, and it is recommended to use EAS Build for packaging and deployment:

1.  **Android Platform Packaging**
    Execute the following command in the project root directory to build an Android installation package (APK or AAB) via EAS:
    ```bash
    eas build --platform android
    ```
    After the build is complete, you can download the generated installation package from the Expo dashboard for distribution or installation.

2.  **iOS Platform Packaging**
    You can also generate an IPA package for the iOS platform using the following command:
    ```bash
    eas build --platform ios
    ```
    However, it has not been fully tested on real Apple devices yet, so it is recommended to use with caution in production environments.

> **Note**: Please ensure that your Expo account, EAS CLI, and relevant platform certificates are configured correctly. Refer to the [Expo Official Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/) for detailed configuration and distribution procedures.

## Current Limitations

### API Support

*   Currently, only Gemini and OpenRouter API channels are supported.
*   Plans to add support for more official API channels in future versions, such as ChatGPT, Claude, etc.
*   Image generation currently only supports NovelAI, plans to add more options.

### Other Known Issues

*   Some advanced features require developers to configure the endpoint themselves.
*   The memory vector database might have performance bottlenecks with a large amount of data.
*   Some features might respond slowly when the network is unstable.
